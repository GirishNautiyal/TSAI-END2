# TSAI-END2-Session5

This was the assignment for END2-Session5:

This session was about hand on practice with code for spaCy Tokenization & PyTorch Embedding along with implementation of sentiment analysis using LSTM / RNN. We import the data, combine it together along with labelling into 5 classes, implement tokenization via spaCy , use random swap, random insertion , random delete functions and train the model and validate the accuracy.

Write a neural network that can:  
1. Look at this code (Links to an external site.) above. It has additional details on "Back Translate", i.e. using Google translate to convert the sentences. It has "random_swap" function, as well as "random_delete". 


2. Use "Back Translate", "random_swap" and "random_delete" to augment the data you are training on

3. Download the Stanford Sentiment Analysis Dataset from this link  ( Links to an external site. ) ( it might be troubling to download it, so force download on chrome ). Use "datasetSentences.txt" and "sentiment_labels.txt" files from the zip you just downloaded as your dataset. This dataset contains just over 10,000 pieces of Stanford data from HTML files of Rotten Tomatoes. The sentiments are rated between 1 and 25, where one is the most negative and 25 is the most positive.

4. Train your model and achieve 60%+ validation/text accuracy. Upload your collab file on GitHub with readme that contains details about your assignment/word (minimum 250 words), training logs showing final validation accuracy, and outcomes for 10 example inputs from the test/validation data. 

5. You must submit before DUE date ( and not "until" date ).
